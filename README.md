## Description
A simple Hot of Cold guessing game built with React and Redux, the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player then tries to guess the number. The player gets feedback for each guess â€“ "hot" if their guess was close, and "cold" if their guess was far. When the user guesses the secret number, the app lets them know, and they'll have the option to start a new game.
